# Fluid Flow Streamlines and Pathlines
This project was originally created beacuse I didn't want to draw streamlines by hand for a homework assignment for ME 326: Intermediate Fluid Mechanics at Clarkson University. I later expanded it by adding the GUI to enter the flows.

The program creates two figures. The first figure includes a table to enter the [inviscid, irrotational, fluid flows](https://webspace.clarkson.edu/projects/fluidflow/public_html/courses/me326/Inviscid.pdf) you wish to draw. It contains other controls to determine how the streamlines or pathlines should be drawn. Make sure you have the 'Enable' column checked for any flow you want to be a part of the graph.

The second figure is the plot containing the streamlines and/or pathlines.
